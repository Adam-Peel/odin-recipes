    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If replacing beef, consider lamb. If using a 'white' meat, consider whether the meat will get more tough if cooked for longer.</p>
        <p>This recipe describes using a heavy pot which will be transferred to the oven. It is possible to not need the oven, and cook on the stove top.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (4 portions)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600g of diced beef</li>
            <li>2 to 4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of madras curry powder (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 large onion - grated</li>
            <li>1 large carrot - grated (optional)</li>
            <li>1 thumb size piece of ginger - grated</li>
            <li>2 whole red chillies, halved (deseeded if desired)</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic - crushed</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground corriander</li>
            <li>500ml passata</li>
            <li>500 ml beef stock</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ghee (or oil)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow beef to come to room temparature, and season well.</li>
            <li>Whilst oven is pre-heating, add a small amount of oil to a heavy pot and brown off the beef in batches on a medium to high heat.</li>
            <li>Set beef aside, retain any 'juices' for the stock, and add 1 tbsp oil to the pot and turn heat to low and allow it to heat gently.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is warmed, add the grated onion, carrot, ginger, and garlic, and sweat the contents.</li>
            <li>At this stage pre-heat the oven (if using) to 140c (fan) or 160c (conventional).</li>
            <li>As the ingredients start to soften and the sugars are released, add the chillis and turn up the heat a small amount.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook for a few minutes, stirring continuously, then add ground corriander and the madras powder.</li>
            <li>If the mixture is dry add a splash of water and coat all ingredients in the spices.</li>
            <li>Add the last tbsp of ghee or oil and reintroduce the beef, coating it well.</li>
            <li>Once the beef is coated, add all other ingredients (stock, passata, bay leaves) and turn up the heat.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture is just ready to 'bubble', take off the heat, cover and place in the oven.</li>
            <li>Cook for at least 45 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken.
            <li>Serve as intended, garnished with fresh corriander and chilli slices.</li>
        </ol>
