    <img src="images/dal.jpg" alt="A photo of a bowl of tarka dal">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Traditional Indian dish with many different variations. In all variations the dal is cooked first, and the tarka (the spice mix) is added afterwards.</p>
        <p>The recipe below is a basic guide to a 'base', and can be modified according to taste.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (4 portions)</h3>
    <h4>For the dal</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>250g of rinsed split yellow dal, or red lentils</li>
            <li>2 to 4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 heaped tsp of turmeric powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>For the Tarka</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large onion - halved and finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 thumb size piece of ginger - finely sliced</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic - finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 tsp mustard seed</li>
            <li>1 tsp hot chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp corriander seed</li>
            <li>3 tbsp ghee (or oil)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you have time, soak the dal in cold water for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours. This is not necessary, but will help soften it in the cooking, for a smoother finish.</li>
            <li>Add all 'dal' ingredients into a heavy based pot and cover generously with cold water.</li>
            <li>Bring dal to the boil, skim off any 'scum' and reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Simmer for at least 45 minutes, or until the dal starts to break up - stir occasionally so it does not stick. If dry, add more boiling water.</li>
            <li>Once the dal starts to break, gently heat 1 tbsp of the ghee or oil and prepare the tarka ingredients.</li>
            <li>As the ghee or oil starts to smoke, add the ginger, garlic, and onion and instantly turn up the heat to 'burn' the slices.</li>
            <li>Stir vigorously, and throw in mustard and corriander seeds after 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Once the seeds start to 'pop', add 1 more tbsp of ghee or oil, the chilli powder and continue to stir vigorously for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Once the chilli powder is burning, add the final tbsp of ghee or oil, stir and take off the heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk the dal to break up the pulses more and take off the heat also.</li>
            <li>For the final step, add 2/3 of the tarka into the dal and mix well.</li>
            <li>Serve as intended, with the final 1/3 of the tarka drizzled on top to add more colour and flavour.</li>
        </ol>
